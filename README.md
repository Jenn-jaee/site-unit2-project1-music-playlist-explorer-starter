### Reflection

**Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment?**
Yes! DOM manipulation, event listeners, and object arrays were crucial for this project. However, implementing modal interactions and dynamic event handling with added playlists pushed me to think more deeply about JavaScript's structure and state.

**If you had more time, what would you have done differently?**
I would‚Äôve implemented editing and deleting playlists completely, and polished the modal's animations for a better user experience. I also wish I had explored using localStorage or backend simulation to persist user-added playlists.

**Reflect on your project demo.**
I‚Äôm proud of how functional and clean the experience feels. I struggled at times with positioning and dynamic rendering, but iterating and debugging helped me level up fast. Seeing everything come together was very fulfilling!

### Shout out

Big shout out to:
